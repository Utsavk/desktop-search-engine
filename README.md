# desktop-search-engine

•	Implemented Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm to search the pattern.  
•	The application searches the desired pattern in all the files of the selected directory.  
•	The pattern is searched in the filenames as well as in the text written in them.

•	It is a windows based search engine, which accepts a string from the user and then comes up with all the relevant files which contains the fed pattern.  
•	The "file rank algorithm" decides that whether a file is to be considered or not and in case of consideration, the algorithm provides a unique rank to such file.  
•	This application is a "Desktop Search Engine" which performs the same task as that of an inbuilt search engine but with a better flexibility and it analyses each file of the system, with greater precision. It tries to find exact matches of the complete input string or even a substring of it in all the txt and rtf files of the system. (Can be enhanced to work for docx files also).
